This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using nested routes with parameters in React Router v6. The problem arises from the parent route unintentionally capturing parameters intended for child routes. The solution involves using the `useParams` hook within nested components to correctly access parameters associated with those specific components. This ensures proper routing and avoids unexpected behavior.
